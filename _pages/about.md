I am currently an undergraduate student at Shandong University. Previously, I worded as a research assistant in the iLearn Lab supervised by Assistant Professor Haoyu Tang and my research focused on developing efficient Dataset Distillation Algorithms. My research interests center on the foundations of deep learning, including distillation, learning algorithms, and optimization. Besides, I also have a lot of experience in computer vision algorithms (e.g., VAE and Diffusion Models). My wish is to explore deeper and find more about these areas.
